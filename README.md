# üõ°Ô∏è SecureVault: A Python-Based Data Loss Prevention (DLP) System
SecureVault is a real-time Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution developed in Python. It monitors and protects sensitive data across various channels, including file systems, clipboard, emails, and external devices. Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques, SecureVault classifies data and enforces security policies to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.

# üöÄ Features
## Real-Time File Monitoring
Detects access and modifications to sensitive documents.
Classifies files using ML/NLP and pattern matching.

## Clipboard & Screen Monitoring
Detects copy-paste actions involving confidential data (e.g., credit card numbers, passwords).
Alerts or blocks actions based on defined security policies.

## Email & Upload Monitoring
Analyzes outgoing emails for attachments and message content.
Blocks or alerts on suspected data leaks.

## External Drive Detection & Restriction
Detects and blocks sensitive data transfers to USB drives.
Applies write protection policies.

## Keyword and Regex-Based Detection
Utilizes custom keywords and regex patterns to detect PII, API keys, internal project names, etc.

## Behavioral Analysis
Detects unusual user activities, such as accessing a large number of files rapidly.
Triggers alerts for abnormal behavior.

## Security Policy Engine
Allows admin-defined rules: block, log, alert, quarantine.
Supports role-based policies for different departments.

## Dashboard & Reporting
Displays incidents, risk scores, and activity timelines.
Exports PDF/CSV logs for audit purposes.
